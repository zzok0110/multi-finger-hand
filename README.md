# multi-finger-hand
Undergraduate graduation project. Design and motion Index analysis of bionic dexterous multi-finger hand.
  ### Physical modelling
    Include the modelling of multi-finger hand (based on Creo 4.0), as well as the tendon rope guidance system design.
  ### Kinematic simulation
    Simulate the motion of the joints and check the fingers fit. (based on Adams 2014)
  ### Workspace by kinematic analysis
    Monte Carlo method and programmed with MATLAB to draw the fingertip workspace scatter cloud maps. (based on MATLAB script)
